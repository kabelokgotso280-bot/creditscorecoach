    <h2>Full checklist to improve your credit score</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Order full credit reports from Experian and TransUnion and review every entry.</li>
      <li>Identify incorrect personal info, duplicate accounts, wrong balances, or fraudulent accounts.</li>
      <li>Use our dispute templates to submit disputes — include proof and keep copies.</li>
      <li>Pay down high utilization accounts first to lower your utilisation ratio.</li>
      <li>Set up payment reminders or debit orders to avoid missed payments.</li>
      <li>Avoid closing old accounts — length of credit history helps your score.</li>
      <li>If you need credit, consider a credit-builder product that reports on-time payments.</li>
      <li>Stagger applications for new credit; too many hard queries close together lowers the score.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Important: In-house car finance & Rent-to-Buy — what to watch out for</h2>
    <p class="small"><strong>In-house car finance</strong> is when the dealer lends to you directly instead of a bank. It can be tempting but comes with risks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Higher interest rates:</strong> Dealers often charge much higher APRs than banks.</li>
      <li><strong>Hidden fees:</strong> Admin fees, markups, and packed insurance can increase total cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Poor reporting:</strong> Some in-house deals don't report positive payments to credit bureaus, so they may not help your credit history.</li>
      <li><strong>Repossession risk:</strong> Defaulting can lead to quick repossession and large negative entries on your report.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small"><strong>Rent-to-Buy (or Rent-to-Own)</strong> often advertises low monthly payments but can be worse long-term:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Expensive over time:</strong> Many rent-to-buy contracts have fees and high overall cost compared to buying via a loan.</li>
      <li><strong>No ownership until fully paid:</strong> If you miss payments you can lose the item and past payments may not count toward ownership.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited credit benefit:</strong> These agreements may not be reported to credit bureaus, so they don't help build credit.</li>
      <li><strong>Complex contracts:</strong> Contracts can include clauses that allow the company to raise fees or repossess quickly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small"><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> If possible, get finance via a bank or regulated lender that reports to Experian/TransUnion, compare APRs, and read the full contract. Use rent-to-buy only as last resort and understand the full cost.</p>
